To build Lift and associated stuff offline (not connected to the internet):

Go through a full "publish" cycle while online.  This insures all the caches, etc. are up to date.

Then:
LIFTSH_OPTS="-Doffline=true" ./liftsh publish-local

Or:
LIFTSH_OPTS="-Doffline=true" ./liftsh

And from the sbt command line:
publish-local

That way you can develop on an airplane or other places where there may not be IP connectivity.
